      <b><blockquote>Tagline</blockquote></b>

    At the 50th anniversary of the infamous war of 1965, a dark conspiracy is in place to instigate war once again. Terrorists are holding the quiet Indian village of Bhuj as hostage and their demands are sure to sour the delicate ties. All three Armed Forces of India must work together to neutralize the situation. The assault on the enemy must be quick and effective. Even a simple oversight may put the life of innocent civilians in jeopardy. First the pilots of the Indian Air Force analyse the conflict zone from the air. They realise that the terrorists have laid siege to the village and are guarding the access paths to the village, both terrestrial and marine. They also acquired a grim piece of intelligence. There are terrorists disguised as civilians hiding among civilians to thwart any attempt at their rescue even if the siege falls.<br>
    The Indian Air Force supplies this intelligence report to the Indian Army along with the ammunition needed to battle the vile forces. Now to break the siege, it must be attacked simultaneously from both land and sea. While the attack from land will be combat-based, the attack from sea needs heavy use of naval artillery. The Naval artillery will be armed with the ammunition provided by the Indian Air Force and supplied by the Indian Army. Once the siege falls, the Indian Army must act fast to rescue the civilians. But the civilians are still endangered by sleeper agent. Using the intelligence provided by the Indian Air Force, the Indian Army must weed him out first. Then it must rescue the civilians and deliver them to safety. <br>
    Death is the only penalty fit for this heinous crime against humanity. This punishment is meted out to the terrorists at the execution zone. Terrorists are supplied to the execution zone by the Indian Navy. Death Sentence is then carried out by the Indian Army. The ammunition used to save the lives of humans is now used to take the lives of these anti-humans.<br>
